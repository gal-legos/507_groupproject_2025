#### Avion Christie
Responsible for selecting and analyzing the Average Braking Force metric and helping develop the data cleaning and flagging logic used in the project.

When some metrics did not consistently appear across environments, worked with teammates to adapt the analysis to the finalized group code. Also contributed to the written report by writing the Average Braking Force literature section and the Limitations section, focusing on data constraints and interpretation, as well as helping explain performance monitoring and flagging results in the slides.
