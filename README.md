#### Ezzah Asad

#### Huma Babar

#### Patrick Brennan

#### Avion Christie
I was responsible for selecting and analyzing the Average Braking Force metric and helping develop the data cleaning and flagging logic used in the project. I wrote and tested Python code in Google Colab to filter athlete data, calculate individual baselines, compare performance to team averages, and identify potential performance flags. When some metrics did not consistently appear across environments, I worked with my teammates and adapted my work to align with the finalized group code while still contributing to the interpretation of results and slide explanations related to performance monitoring and flagging in the slides.
#### Emily Gallegos
Responsible for the part3_viz_dashboard and part3_viz_comparison notebook files. Other major responsibilities included the results section of the Sports Analytics Presentation and the Discussion portion of the synthesis paper. Minor responsibilities included compiling the part 1 summary and screenshots into a pdf file to make it readable for readers to access, as well as attaching the synthesis paper and literature review PDFs to the GitHub repository.
